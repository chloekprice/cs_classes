Students will build on the algorithms and problem-solving strategies that they were taught and had limited practice with in CS 312. learning primarily through targeted practice.  This will result in (1) strengthened skills in each style of problem-solving strategy and (2) the ability to quickly decide which strategy(ies) to apply to a given problem.  Students are expected to spend 6+ hours outside of class each week solving interview-type problems. ",
